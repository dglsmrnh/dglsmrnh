- 👋 Hi, I’m Douglas. A Salesforce Developer with nine years of software development experience, including five years working with different Salesforce environments. I have strong experience delivering scalable solutions, integrations, and automations aligned with business needs.
In my current role, I design and implement Salesforce features using Apex and Lightning Web Components, collaborate with stakeholders in agile teams, and support system evolution during business and process changes. I also bring a solid background in back-end development and databases, which supports reliable system integrations and data-driven solutions.
I am motivated by challenging projects and believe my experience would allow me to contribute effectively as a Senior Salesforce Developer..
